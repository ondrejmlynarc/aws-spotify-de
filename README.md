This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline on the AWS cloud, empowering you to store, transform, analyze, and visualize data seamlessly.

## Overview

Follow this comprehensive guide to build a data workflow that leverages the power of:

* **Amazon S3:** Secure and scalable data storage
* **AWS Glue:** Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service
* **Amazon Athena:** Interactive querying of S3 data using standard SQL
* **Amazon QuickSight:** Business intelligence for creating insightful visualizations

## Features

* **Data Storage:** Efficiently store raw and processed data in S3 buckets.
* **ETL Processes:**  Clean, enrich, and load data into a structured format with AWS Glue's powerful ETL capabilities (PySpark scripts).
* **Querying:** Analyze your data with the familiar SQL interface of Athena, directly querying data residing in S3.
* **Visualization:** Create dynamic dashboards and reports in QuickSight to uncover valuable insights.

## Prerequisites

* An active AWS account
* Foundational knowledge of AWS services
* Familiarity with PySpark (for custom Glue ETL scripts)
